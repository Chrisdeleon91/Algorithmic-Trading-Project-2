## How to use

https://github.com/Chrisdeleon91/Algorithmic-Trading-Project-2
1. run .ipynb to open jupyter notebook
2. run streamline_hft.py (using python, must pip install streamlit) in terminal,  type in command " streamlit run streamline_HFT.py" in terminal to view

### Authors: Christopher De Leon, Victor Andujar, Russell Gould

### Introduction

Algorithmic trading...

* **System Design & Architecture**: To be led by Christopher, outlining the main components of the trading system and how they will interact.

* **Algorithm Development**: Chris and Russell will collaborate to design, test and optimize our high-frequency trading algorithms using Backtrader.

* **Interface Design**: Victor will take the helm in designing a sleek, intuitive, and interactive interface using Streamlit, ensuring the system is user-friendly and efficient.

* **Data Management**: Victor and Russell will ata sourcing, formatting and data management.

* **Integration & Testing**: The team will collaborate in this final phase to integrate all system components, followed by rigorous testing to ensure optimal performance.

### Research Questions
**Our research questions are as follows**:
* 
* 
* 
* 

### Datasets
We will use the following datasets in our project:
* 
* 

### Overview of Tasks
* Data cleaning and formatting
* Algorithm development
* Visualization
* Integration
* Backtesting
* Paper trading

### Tasks in detail

Our project will be divided into the following tasks:

**Data Cleaning and Formatting**

We will use Pandas to clean and format the cryptocurrency dataset. This will involve removing any errors in the data, converting the data to the correct format and creating any new columns that are needed.

**Algorithm Development**

We will use a library/API, such as Zipline or PyFinance, to implement our HFT algorithm. We will need to develop a trading strategy that can identify and exploit profitable trading opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.

**Visualization**

We will use PyViz, GeoView, and Hvplot to create six to eight visualizations of our data. These visualizations will help us to understand the data and to identify any potential trading opportunities.

**Integration**

We will use Streamlit to integrate the six to eight visualizations required. Streamlit will allow us to create a web-based dashboard that will make it easy to monitor the performance of our trading system.

**Paper Trading**

Once we are satisfied with the performance of our system in backtesting, we will deploy it to a paper trading account. This will allow us to test our system in real-world market conditions without risking any real money.

**Optimization**

We will monitor the performance of our trading system in paper trading and make adjustments to our algorithm as needed. Our goal is to optimize our system to generate the highest possible returns.

### Conclusion

We believe that this project has the potential to develop a profitable algorithmic trading system for cryptocurrencies. We are committed to working hard to complete this project on time and within budget. We look forward to sharing our results with the class and the instructional team.
